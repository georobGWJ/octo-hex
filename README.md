## octo-hex

This project is building develop a hex editor using Electron. I'm drawing
inspiration from [010](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/).

For now, I am using a prebuilt version of Electron v1.4.13.
This is in my .gitignore file. If you want to run this code you need to
install [node.js](https://nodejs.org) and then run:
```npm install electron --save-dev``` from within the octo-hex directory.
